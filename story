came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered 
him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife she ate the fruits and liked them,
but was jealous, as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband,
"if the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey heart would be".
